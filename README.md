🔍 Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

This project demonstrates how to implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify the Iris dataset, focusing on normalization, model evaluation, and decision boundary visualization.

🎯 Objective

To understand and apply the KNN algorithm for classification problems using:

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib

📁 Dataset Used

Iris Dataset (from sklearn.datasets.load_iris())

🛠️ What You'll Learn

How instance-based learning works

Importance of normalization

Role of Euclidean distance

How to choose the optimal K value

Visualization of decision boundaries

🚀 How to Run This Project

Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Install the required packages:

bash

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
